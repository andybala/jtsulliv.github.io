I'm a Senior Analyst in a consulting role to the government, with a background in computational physics, mathematical modeling, and numerical methods.  I develop physics simulations to provide data-driven recommendations to the government that help influence business decisions.

I'm a graduate of Northeastern University (MS Mechanical Engineering), with a concentration in applied mathematics of thermofluids.  As an undergrad, I attended UMass Amherst (BSME), where I also studied mechanical engineering.
